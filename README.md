# Agentic-E-Commerce-Platform

Agentic AI architecture for an E-Commerce platform, designed in a Google Cloud-native way (using GCP services + open-source agent frameworks), and focused on enabling multi-agent orchestration, LLM flexibility, and modular AI components for personalized, scalable customer and operations experiences.

- Dynamically select between open-source and commercial LLMs.
- Modular agents for product discovery, cart management, shipping, fraud detection.
